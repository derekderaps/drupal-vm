# List multisites / sub-domains.
# @TODO break multisites and just extra sub-domains into separate variables so
# that we can know which need `sites.php` config (the former) and which don't
# (the latter). The `ucsf-multisite.yml` task and `ucsf--local.sites.inc.j2`
# template are currently hard-coded to act on the UCSF site only.
